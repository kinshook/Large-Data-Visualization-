📊Daikibo Downtime Visualization Dashboard
An intercative visual too built to analyse the downtime of devices at daikibo industries

📄Project Description:Visualization Dashboard is designed to analyze downtime patterns across various device types,
providing an intuitive interface for tracking failures happening in which factory, identifying trends, and optimizing machine performance for DAIKIBO Industries. 
Built with Tableau, this dashboard transforms complex data into actionable insights!

👩‍💻Technology Stack: The Dashboard visualization used the following technology for its completion-
💻Tableau Public - Main data visualization platform to visualize the .json format of data fro report creation
🌐HTML - To make the dashboard presentation and access convenient
🔗Git- For version control and clear record of changes in the project files, locally and remotely 
📟Data Analysis Expressions(DAX)- To calculate the downtime parameter to classify unhealthy devices and which factory 
                                needed more attention

Feature and Highlights:The Daikibo Tech Team has successfully compiled telemetry data from four manufacturing facilities-
🏭 Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
🏭 Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
🏭 Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany) 
🏭 Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
⛓️‍💥  Business Problem- Each location operates nine types of machines, continuously transmitting performance data every 10 minutes. Ther eare certain machines which are not healthy and affecting the performance.
🎯Goals- The primary goal of this telemetry collection was to address two critical operational questions: ✅ Which factory experienced the highest machine failure rate? ✅ Which machines were most frequently impacted at that location?
👩‍💼Business Impact:To answer these pressing questions, I leveraged the power of Tableau. This dashboard enables Daikibo's tech team to: 
  🔹 Visualize machine breakdown patterns across locations 
  🔹 Identify trends that influence equipment reliability 
  🔹 Enhance decision-making by pinpointing high-risk machinery

Through this project, I deepened my expertise in data visualization, hand on json file format, git and github, honing my ability to transform refined telemetry into meaningful, actionable insights!
